## Abstract: 

After summing up this paper we understand that there are a lots of Projects on Python which are open source means avaiable for public to view and edit them as they want, Over the period of 165 months we collected  repositories and sorted them and there developer contacts so they can be easily contacted if there is any difficulty. 

## Introduction: 

Now a days there are lots of open source projects avaiable from simple softwares so highly effective softwares and they are open source so that every software developer can edit and make them much more useable.These projects are maintained by a decentralized team of developers, who with low organizational cost,are able to produce applications that are at times used by millions. 

## Data:

Data is really important as of now and if you have more data of repositries you can make a better contribution to community. While analysing Data plays a key role in those analysis of data sets consiting of repositries, so if you have good data set you can reach a good level of consistancy and accuracy. 

## Method:
Method used for this project are really easy and available for everyone the method used in it is called Survival Analysis Method. 

## Result: 

Results were as follow.
+ Major Releases whether releases were published by the project developers.
+ HostType type of hosting service used for the project repository.
+ AuthorCount total unique developers that have committed a revision to the repository.
+ Multiple Repositories whether the project is hosted on multiple version control
 systems. 
 
## Conclusion: 
From this paper we concluded that  this project aim for betterment of open source projects that are now avaiable for everyone and to make them more accessible and easy to understand.
