## Abstract:   

Summing up this we can understand that many Software Developers know about code duplication but many do not pay more attention to Stact Overflow clones which have many reuseable components so we will discuss genral clones and clones that are found on Stack Overflow and differences between them. 

## Introduction:  

On Stact Overflow code snippts are well explained and ready to use and very much maintainable but in general clones that is much diffcult  because in those first you have to understand code and than copy paste it and that reuse it in your project so it creates a really big problem for software developers.

Studies have shown that developers utilise code snippets from SO in their software projects, regardless of maintainability, security,and licensing implications.

The main focus of that previous work was, however, to study how and why developers reuse SO code snippets outside of the question and answer platform. The purpose of this article is to point the research community to open questions regarding code clones on SO and to motivate how  research in that area could inform significant improvements for the platform.Our vision is that a thorough study of code clones on SO together with the ongoing discussion in the SO community will lead to revised recommendations for authors and improved tool support  for handling those clones.

## MOTIVATION :

In this paper we want to discuss two use cases of duplicated code.
### CASE-1:
Original code snippets being reused in multiple threads:

+ This case covers content that was originally posted on SO without any indication of an external source.

### CASE-2: 
Externally availabe snippets being resued in multiple threads:

+ This case covers content that was copied from external sources into SO posts. 

## Conclusion:   
From this paper we concluded that Stack overflow clones similar to clones in regular software projects, affect the maintainability of posts and can lead to licensing issues. However, we also concluded  that SO users may be encouraged to clone successful answers to achieve a higher reputation and that snippets are difficult to modify through bulk edits. With this research paper we want to make software developers to be using more more and more Stack Overflow code so it would be easy for them to maintain and reuse same code in other projects.
